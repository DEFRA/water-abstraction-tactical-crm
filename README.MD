This component is one of 3 that combine to give you the ability to store a document or details of a permit or pass, to link those documents to users that can view and be able to have different access for internal and external users. With a front end it will enable most processes to capture, share and view details of permits and or licence style information

**Permit Repository:** <https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-permit-repository>

**IDM:** <https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-tactical-idm>

**CRM:** <https://github.com/DEFRA/water-abstraction-tactical-crm>

The tactical CRM is a lightweight CRM solution providing a means of managing:

- **Entities**
  - **Individuals** - a person who may have one or more roles enabling them to view documents within one or many organisations
  - **Organisations** - a business or organisation that has one or more documents
  - **Regimes** - a high level means of grouping documents, e.g. ‘Water’ or ‘Waste’
- **Documents** - references documents such as licences or permits for a particular organisation (these may be stored in the permit repository or other systems)
- **Roles** - manages the relationship of individuals to an organisation and regime
- **Verifications** - facilitates the process of a user verifying they have permission to access a particular organisation’s documents

The tactical CRM is developed in HAPI/NodeJS and backed by a Postgres SQL database. All data is transferred via a REST API with JWT authentication.

The REST API supports basic filtering and pagination operations on all endpoints.

Implementation of user interfaces, IDM, and permit data storage is left open to the specific use case requirements.
